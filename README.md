# StuBank-Team-Project
Android banking app produced as part of CSC2033 - Software Engineering Team Project at Newcastle University.

The app was developed using Android Studio, and can be run on an Android phone or an Android emulator.

  [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/) was used for the database as it was free, and provided its own API to make linking our application and database much easier.
